PROCESSING and ANALYSIS
This portion of the project includes our data preprocessing, cleaning, feature
engineering, queries, visualization, and storage.

Please note some functions used in querying and visualization are moved into
the module cs_proj_functions to improve readability of our analysis, simplify
unit testing, and for use in the visualization tool portion.
